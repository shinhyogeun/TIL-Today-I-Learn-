<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-mobile-hub-images/aws-amplify-logo.png" alt="AWS Amplify" width="550" >
AWS Amplify provides a declarative and easy-to-use interface across different categories of cloud operations. AWS Amplify goes well with any JavaScript based frontend workflow, and React Native for mobile developers.

Our default implementation works with Amazon Web Services (AWS), but AWS Amplify is designed to be open and pluggable for any custom backend or service.

let request = rekognitionService.AWSRekognitionCreateCollectionRequest()
rekognitionService.createCollection(request)
```

## Platform Support

Amplify supports iOS 11 and above and iOS 13 for certain categories such as Predictions. There are currently no plans to support Amplify on WatchOS, tvOS, or MacOS.

## License

This library is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. 

## Installation

Amplify requires Xcode 11 or higher to build.

### CocoaPods

| :information_source: For more detailed instructions, follow the getting started guides in our [documentation site](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/q/platform/ios)   |
|-------------------------------------------------|

1. Amplify for iOS is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). If you have not installed CocoaPods, install CocoaPods by running the command:
    ```
    $ gem install cocoapods
    $ pod setup
    ```

    Depending on your system settings, you may have to use `sudo` for installing `cocoapods` as follows:
    
    ```
    $ sudo gem install cocoapods
    $ pod setup
    ```

2. In your project directory (the directory where your `*.xcodeproj` file is), type `pod init` and open the Podfile that was created. Add the `Amplify` pod and any plugins you would like to use. Below is an example of what a podfile might look like if you were going to use the Predictions plugin.
    ```ruby
    source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
    
    platform :ios, '13.0'
    use_frameworks!

    target :'YourTarget' do
        pod 'Amplify'
        pod 'AmplifyPlugins/AWSCognitoAuthPlugin'
        pod 'AWSPredictionsPlugin'
        pod 'CoreMLPredictionsPlugin'
    end
    ```
        
3. Then run the following command:
    ```
    $ pod install
    ```
4. Open up `*.xcworkspace` with Xcode and start using Amplify.

    **Note**: Do **NOT** use `*.xcodeproj`. If you open up a project file instead of a workspace, you will receive an error.

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

Support for SPM coming soon. Follow [#90](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios/issues/90) for updates.

### Carthage

Support for Carthage coming soon. Follow [#280](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios/issues/280) for updates.

### Development Pods

You can manually install the library by cloning this repo and creating a Podfile that references your local clone of it like below:

```ruby
pod 'Amplify', :path => '~/amplify-ios'
pod 'AWSPluginsCore', :path => '~/amplify-ios'
pod 'CoreMLPredictionsPlugin', :path => '~/amplify-ios'
pod 'AWSPredictionsPlugin', :path => '~/amplify-ios'
pod 'AmplifyPlugins/AWSAPIPlugin', :path => '~/amplify-ios'
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```
pod install
```

Open your project using ./YOUR-PROJECT-NAME.xcworkspace file. Remember to always use ./YOUR-PROJECT-NAME.xcworkspace to open your Xcode project from now on.
